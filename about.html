<p>
ECOTH began as a small, course-based project that has since grown into a reality. The idea first emerged in Fall 2024, when Dr. Rebry offered a course on Environmental Literature. Following the course, work began to transform the concept into a full conference. The organizing committee consulted with research deans and conference services, and by July 2025 it was officially confirmed that the conference would move forward.

This conference would not be possible without the generous support of sponsors from both the community and the University of Lethbridge. LPIRG (lethbridge Public Interest Group) has been our biggest supporter with thier generous Event Grant. The English Department and the Deanâ€™s Office have provided financial support, while the Vice-Provost (Students) has contributed by assisting with swag bags. The University Bookstore will also be showcasing a display of environmental books. Our community partners have answered the call as well: Analog Books has generously donated prizes for presenters, Sill and Soil and Urbane Eight have offered contributions, and Environmental Lethbridge has pledged their support.
